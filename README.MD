# General description
Our robot's size is about 20 cm lenght,14 cm width and 27 cm height.We used gyro sensor to identify how many degrees robot should turn to.Also we used ultrasonic sensor to determine a free space for our robot to turn to
# Motor selection
We have chosen medium motor instead of large one due to its great pace.We used overall 3 medium motors.2 of them we used for comman movement,and we used 1 motor for changing direction of robot,moving it to right or left side depending on the situation 
# Camera position 
We put camera as much higher as it possible to provide full view and identify colors with more accuracy
